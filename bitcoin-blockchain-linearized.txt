How to start a full node in one day from scratch

Since the early beginnings the Bitcoin blockchain was being
synchronized by starting from the genesis block, downloading and
verifying all the blocks up till the current time.

Although this approach is impractical for initial blockchain sync
in 2020 there is a general mistrust or even discouragement of
distributing the block files otherwise.

Let's have a look at the block files

The block files are located in blocks/blk*.dat^.
When comparing the SHA256 checksum of any particular blk*.dat
file on two different systems (full nodes), both synchronized
from scratch, they may not match.

 ^ see doc/files.md in Bitcoin sources

In order to turn the block files in shape (to comb them) there is
a tool inside contrib/linearize in Bitcoin's sources. When linearized,
each blk*.dat file ends up to be the same^ on every system that does
the linearization and the checksums match.

 ^ note: max_out_sz=134217728 which is 128*1024*1024

    $ cd bitcoin/src
    bitcoin/src$ grep MAX_BLOCKFILE_SIZE validation.h
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCKFILE_SIZE = 0x8000000; // 128 MiB


Thus linearized block files are a good fit to be shared over Torrent
while retaining their use as Bitcoin's block files without storing
their content twice (wasting space on HDD or SSD).

Step by step guide

There are multiple different paths to chose from. Both of them lead
to a full node which ends up to have canonized block files.

  1. Linearize block files of an already synced full node
  2. Sync a full node over torrent

One more advantage is that there is a signed SHA256SUMS^ file which
can be used to check all the block files in order to prove their
authenticity. Such file can be signed by any and all full-node
owners and provide a trusted way to do the initial sync of the
blockchain quickly.

I own bitcoin. Only.
When I write Bitcoin I mean bitcoin.org and bitcoincore.org
